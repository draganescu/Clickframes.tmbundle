Hello,

Wellcome in the fine world of solid high quality specs.
The clickframes framework is a unique tool that allows both better and faster coding for teams any size and projects any complex :)

Better coding is achieved by a unique source of specification and requirement. At the base of all the specs is one XML file that can be translated easily into visual slides accesible to the less technical of the team.

Faster coding is offered by the framework's plugins which generate stub applications based on the same XML file with specs.

This textmate bundle allows faster adoption of the framework, but in order to use it you need to follow the instructions at:

In oder for the syntax validation to work you need the clickframes.xsd in the project folder.
